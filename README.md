# **Portfolio-Prediction-of-Student-Score**
This is my portfolio with developed with guidance from dibimbing.id, that demonstrates the application of a regression algorithm in Machine Learning.
This project aims to predict student scores based on the number of hours they study. By utilizing a linear regression algorithm, we establish a relationship between the number of study hours (independent variable) and the scores achieved by students (dependent variable).

# **Results**
The trained linear regression model produces predictions with an acceptable accuracy based on the provided data.
